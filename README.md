**Fine-Tuning and OCR Extraction using Qwen2-VL**
Overview
This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of the Qwen2-VL model on a custom dataset for OCR extraction tasks. The objective is to extract important product information such as:

Brand Name
MRP
Expiry Date
Manufacturing Details
Category
Weight/Volume
The model is optimized to work with product images, where it automatically identifies and extracts this textual information.

**Solution Workflow**
1. Dataset Preparation
We collected and preprocessed a custom dataset comprising product images for fine-tuning the model. The images include the following features:

Brand labels
Product packaging with MRP and other details
Preprocessing:
To ensure data consistency and format, we run a preprocessing script, preprocess_train.py, which cleans and standardizes the training data. The images are processed for optimal input into the model, with labels aligned for OCR.

2. JSON Creation
The prepared dataset is converted into a structured format (JSON) compatible with the fine-tuning process. This JSON file contains image paths, along with bounding boxes or annotations for target text extraction (e.g., MRP, brand name, etc.).

3. **Fine-Tuning the Model**
We utilize the Qwen2-VL model, a vision-language model from Hugging Face, for OCR tasks. Fine-tuning is performed using the notebook finetune.ipynb. The training settings are configured via the WebUI to:

Adapt the model for product-specific text extraction
Optimize for accuracy in recognizing brand-specific information
The fine-tuning leverages LoRA for efficient low-rank adaptation, ensuring the model learns from our custom dataset while maintaining general OCR capabilities.

4. **Inference on Fine-Tuned Model**
Once the model is fine-tuned, we perform inference using inference.py. This script takes an input image of a product and outputs the extracted information (e.g., brand name, MRP, expiry date).

**Experimentation Details**
Model Used: Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct
Finetuning Framework: We fine-tuned the model specifically to extract text related to product labels and packaging.
Tools and Techniques: The model is optimized using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning.
